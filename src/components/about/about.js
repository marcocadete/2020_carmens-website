                <p>
                  Iâ€™m a self-taught graphic designer based in Germany. My
                  passion for Graphic design started 8 years ago when I
                  discovered Photoshop.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have gained experience working in an in-house design studio,
                  a graphic design, and print studio, as a marketing coordinator
                  for an automotive company, as well as designing on a freelance
                  basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I maintain a healthy balance between functionality and form,
                  and I would consider my design style as minimalistic. My goal
                  is to guide an audience to act through communicating strategic
                  design solutions.
                </p>

                    Understanding all the pain points of the project and
                    collaborating every step of the way is an important part of
                    my process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I enjoy keeping up with the latest design trends and love
                    improving my skills in my free time.
